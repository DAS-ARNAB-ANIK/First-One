# First-One
### One of my seniors asked me to get academic emails for about 63 students from their academic ID's
#This python3.8 code is here for this specific purpose
#You can change the ID's inside the initial list named "P" inside the code according to your need.
#Then edit the format of the email inside the for loop
#and run the code
#You will get the emails for those ID's
